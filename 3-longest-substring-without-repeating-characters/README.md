<summary>📄 Problem Statement</summary>

Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest** **substring** without duplicate characters.

 Example 1:**

```text

**Input:** s = "abcabcbb"
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. Note that `"bca"` and `"cab"` are also correct answers.

```

 Example 2:**

```text

**Input:** s = "bbbbb"
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

```

 Example 3:**

```text

**Input:** s = "pwwkew"
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`

- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

</details>

## 💡 Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        int max = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
             Set<Character> map = new HashSet<>();
            for(int j = i; j < s.length(); j++){
                if(!map.contains(s.charAt(j))){
                    map.add(s.charAt(j));
                    max = Math.max(max, j - i +1);
                }
                else{
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
