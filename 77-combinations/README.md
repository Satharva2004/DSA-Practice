<summary>📄 Problem Statement</summary>

Given two integers `n` and `k`, return *all possible combinations of* `k` *numbers chosen from the range* `[1, n]`.

You may return the answer in **any order**.

 Example 1:**

```text

**Input:** n = 4, k = 2
**Output:** [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]]
**Explanation:** There are 4 choose 2 = 6 total combinations.
Note that combinations are unordered, i.e., [1,2] and [2,1] are considered to be the same combination.

```

 Example 2:**

```text

**Input:** n = 1, k = 1
**Output:** [[1]]
**Explanation:** There is 1 choose 1 = 1 total combination.

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 20`

- `1 <= k <= n`

</details>

## 💡 Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> combine(int n, int k) {
        List<List<Integer>> list = new ArrayList<>();
        backtracking(n, k, new ArrayList<>(), list);
        return list;
    }
    public void backtracking(int n, int k, List<Integer> curr, List<List<Integer>> ans){
        if(k==0){
             ans.add(new ArrayList<>(curr));
             return;
        }
        if(n==0) return;
        curr.add(n);
        backtracking(n-1, k-1, curr, ans);
        curr.remove(curr.size()-1);
        backtracking(n-1, k, curr, ans);
    }
}
```
