<summary>Problem statement</summary>

## Problem Statement

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array*. Answers within `10 -5 ` of the actual answer will be accepted.

 Example 1:**

```text

**Input:** root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
**Output:** [3.00000,14.50000,11.00000]
Explanation: The average value of nodes on level 0 is 3, on level 1 is 14.5, and on level 2 is 11.
Hence return [3, 14.5, 11].

```

 Example 2:**

```text

**Input:** root = [3,9,20,15,7]
**Output:** [3.00000,14.50000,11.00000]

```

 **Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10 4 ]`.

- `-2 31 31 - 1`

## Code

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public List<Double> averageOfLevels(TreeNode root) {
        List<Double> result = new ArrayList();
        double sum = 0;
        Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList();
        queue.offer(root);
        while(!queue.isEmpty()){
            sum = 0;
            int size = queue.size();
            for(int i = 0; i < size; i++){
                TreeNode curr = queue.poll();
                sum = sum + curr.val;
                if(curr.left != null) queue.offer(curr.left);
                if(curr.right != null) queue.offer(curr.right);
            }
            result.add(sum/size);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
