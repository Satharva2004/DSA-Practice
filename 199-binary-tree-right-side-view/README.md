<summary>Problem statement</summary>

## Problem Statement

Given the `root` of a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the **right side** of it, return *the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom*.

 Example 1:**

 **Input:** root = [1,2,3,null,5,null,4]

 **Output:** [1,3,4]

 **Explanation:**

 Example 2:**

 **Input:** root = [1,2,3,4,null,null,null,5]

 **Output:** [1,3,4,5]

 **Explanation:**

 Example 3:**

 **Input:** root = [1,null,3]

 **Output:** [1,3]

 Example 4:**

 **Input:** root = []

 **Output:** []

 **Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.

- `-100

## Code

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

    public List<Integer> rightSideView(TreeNode root) {
        Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList();
        if(root == null) return res;
        queue.offer(root);
        while(!queue.isEmpty()){
            int size = queue.size();
            for(int i = 0; i < size; i++){
                TreeNode curr = queue.poll();
                if(i == size-1) res.add(curr.val);
                if(curr.left != null) queue.offer(curr.left);
                if(curr.right != null) queue.offer(curr.right); 
            }
        }
        return res;
