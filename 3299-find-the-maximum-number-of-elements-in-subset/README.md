<summary>📄 Problem Statement</summary>

You are given an array of **positive** integers `nums`.

You need to select a subset of `nums` which satisfies the following condition:

- You can place the selected elements in a **0-indexed** array such that it follows the pattern: `[x, x^2, x^4, ..., x^k/2, x^k, x^k/2, ..., x^4, x^2, x]` (**Note** that `k` can be be any **non-negative** power of `2`). For example, `[2, 4, 16, 4, 2]` and `[3, 9, 3]` follow the pattern while `[2, 4, 8, 4, 2]` does not.

Return *the **maximum** number of elements in a subset that satisfies these conditions.*

 Example 1:**

```text

**Input:** nums = [5,4,1,2,2]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** We can select the subset {4,2,2}, which can be placed in the array as [2,4,2] which follows the pattern and 2^2 == 4. Hence the answer is 3.

```

 Example 2:**

```text

**Input:** nums = [1,3,2,4]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** We can select the subset {1}, which can be placed in the array as [1] which follows the pattern. Hence the answer is 1. Note that we could have also selected the subsets {2}, {3}, or {4}, there may be multiple subsets which provide the same answer.

```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^5`

- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

</details>

## 💡 Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumLength(int[] nums) {
        HashMap<Long, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
            map.put((long)nums[i], map.getOrDefault((long)nums[i], 0) +1);
        }
        int ans = 0;
        if(map.containsKey(1L)){
            int ones = map.get(1L);
            ans = (ones%2==0) ? ones-1 : ones;
            map.remove(1L);
        }
        for(long num: map.keySet()){
            int count = 0;
            long curr = num;
            while(map.containsKey(curr)){
                if (map.get(curr) >= 2) {
                    count += 2;
                } else {
                    count++;
                    break;
                }
                curr = curr*curr;
            }
            if(count%2==0) count--;
            ans = Math.max(ans, count);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
