<summary>Problem statement</summary>

## Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of size `n`.

 Define two arrays `leftSum` and `rightSum` where:

- `leftSum[i]` is the sum of elements to the left of the index `i` in the array `nums`. If there is no such element, `leftSum[i] = 0`.

- `rightSum[i]` is the sum of elements to the right of the index `i` in the array `nums`. If there is no such element, `rightSum[i] = 0`.

 Return an integer array `answer` of size `n` where `answer[i] = |leftSum[i] - rightSum[i]|`.

 Example 1:**

```text

**Input:** nums = [10,4,8,3]
**Output:** [15,1,11,22]
**Explanation:** The array leftSum is [0,10,14,22] and the array rightSum is [15,11,3,0].
The array answer is [|0 - 15|,|10 - 11|,|14 - 3|,|22 - 0|] = [15,1,11,22].

```

 Example 2:**

```text

**Input:** nums = [1]
**Output:** [0]
**Explanation:** The array leftSum is [0] and the array rightSum is [0].
The array answer is [|0 - 0|] = [0].

```

 **Constraints:**

- `1 5 `

## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] leftRightDifference(int[] nums) {
        int leftSum[] = new int[nums.length];
        int rightSum[] = new int[nums.length];
        int answer[] = new int[nums.length];

        int sumleft = 0;
        int sumright = 0;

        leftSum[0] = 0;
        rightSum[nums.length - 1] = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            sumleft += nums[i - 1];   // fixed
            leftSum[i] = sumleft;
        }

        for (int i = nums.length - 2; i >= 0; i--) { 
            sumright += nums[i + 1];                
            rightSum[i] = sumright;                 
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            answer[i] = Math.abs(leftSum[i] - rightSum[i]); 
        }

        return answer;
    }
}
```
