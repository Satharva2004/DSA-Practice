<summary>📄 Problem Statement</summary>

You are given an integer `n`. Your task is to compute the **GCD** (greatest common divisor) of two values:

-
	`sumOdd`: the sum of the smallest `n` positive odd numbers.

-
	`sumEven`: the sum of the smallest `n` positive even numbers.

Return the GCD of `sumOdd` and `sumEven`.

 Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

- Sum of the first 4 odd numbers `sumOdd = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16`

- Sum of the first 4 even numbers `sumEven = 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20`

Hence, `GCD(sumOdd, sumEven) = GCD(16, 20) = 4`.

 Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 5

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:**

- Sum of the first 5 odd numbers `sumOdd = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25`

- Sum of the first 5 even numbers `sumEven = 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30`

Hence, `GCD(sumOdd, sumEven) = GCD(25, 30) = 5`.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10​​​​​​​00`

## 💡 Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int gcdOfOddEvenSums(int n) {
        int count1 = n;
        int count2 = n;
        int sumOdd = 0;
        int sumEven = 0;
        int i = 1, j = 1;
        while(count1 != 0){
            if(i%2==0){
                sumOdd += i;
                count1--;
            }
            i++;
        }
        while(count2 != 0){
            if(j%2!=0){
                sumEven += j;
                count2--;
            }
            j++;
        }
        return findGCD(sumOdd, sumEven);

    }
    public static int findGCD(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            int temp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }

}
```
