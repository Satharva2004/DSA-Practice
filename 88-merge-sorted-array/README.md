<summary>📄 Problem Statement</summary>

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

**Merge** `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be *stored inside the array *`nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

 Example 1:**

```text

**Input:** nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
**Output:** [1,2,2,3,5,6]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [ 1 , 2 ,2, 3 ,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

```

 Example 2:**

```text

**Input:** nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
**Output:** [1]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].

```

 Example 3:**

```text

**Input:** nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
**Output:** [1]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.

```

**Constraints:**

- `nums1.length == m + n`

- `nums2.length == n`

- `0 <= m, n <= 200`

- `1 <= m + n <= 200`

- `-10^9 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 10^9`

**Follow up: **Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?

</details>

## 💡 Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {
        int len1 = m-1;
        int len2 = n-1;
        int k = m+n-1;
        while(len1 >= 0 && len2 >= 0){
            if(nums1[len1] > nums2[len2]){
                nums1[k] = nums1[len1];
                len1--;
            }else{
                nums1[k] = nums2[len2];
                len2--;
            }
            k--;
        }
        while(len2>=0){
            nums1[k] = nums2[len2];
            len2--;
            k--;
        }
    }
}
```
