<summary>Problem statement</summary>

## Problem Statement

Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return `true` if the tree has a **root-to-leaf** path such that adding up all the values along the path equals `targetSum`.

 A **leaf** is a node with no children.

 Example 1:**

```text

**Input:** root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.

```

 Example 2:**

```text

**Input:** root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There are two root-to-leaf paths in the tree:
(1 --> 2): The sum is 3.
(1 --> 3): The sum is 4.
There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 5.

```

 Example 3:**

```text

**Input:** root = [], targetSum = 0
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Since the tree is empty, there are no root-to-leaf paths.

```

 **Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5000]`.

- `-1000

 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

class Solution {
    public boolean hasPathSum(TreeNode root, int targetSum) {
        return dfs(root, targetSum, 0);
    }
    public boolean dfs(TreeNode root, int targetSum, int sum){
        if(root == null) return false;
        sum += root.val;
        if(root.right == null && root.left == null) return sum == targetSum;

        return dfs(root.left, targetSum, sum) || dfs(root.right, targetSum, sum);
    }
}
